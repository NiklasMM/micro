# listinput

* SNIPPET ctx refactor
* TODO list_input -> list_input.html and list_input.js
  should also get rid of problem that input.value is assigned before custom element ist registered

* TODO options

* what if current/given values are not unique and set = true? should we filter?
  guess so

* OQ style of remove button
* OQ what should happen on blur
  leave input as is, or add it to list of values?
